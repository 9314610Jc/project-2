# project-2 Fitness Tracker

This Project is Fitness Tracker that Allows you to save workouts/calories burned and access them later. You also have the ability to see workouts that other users have completed.

## User Story

As a user desiring to get in shape I want to keep track of my workouts. I am using this application to save and reference workouts I have done in the past.

As competitive bodybuilder I need to keep detailed notes on my workouts and calorie output. This app allows me to look back at every detail I input and make sure I am staying on track. 

## Motivation

The main reason this project was chosen was to provide a way to help people keep track of fitness post COVID-19. With many people unable to stay on top of their fitness after gym closures, we wanted to create an application that would make fitnesss tracking easier as gyms begin to reopen.

## Our Application uses:

Handlebars, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Sequelize, NPM, Gulp, MySQL, Travis and ESLint.

## Future Developement

Mobile funcitonality, Adding Friends, Look at other people's profiles, Add Body specific workout grouping (Upper body, Lower Body, etc)
